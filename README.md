The goal of this project is to develop a robust, secure, and user-friendly web application that allows users to register, log in, and update their account information while ensuring data validation, security, and usability. This project goes beyond individual coursework and emphasizes collaborative software development, requiring effective team coordination, integration, and adherence to industry best practices.

We are building upon provided foundational code to implement new user stories while maintaining the integrity of the existing architecture and improving input validation. This involves:

1.      Developing secure authentication (account creation, login, and profile updates).
2.      Implementing strong input validation to ensure data integrity.
3.      Enhancing UI/UX based on research into professionally designed applications.
4.      Documenting the system with UML diagrams and maintaining up-to-date architecture.
5.      Ensuring code consistency so that it appears as if written by a single author.
4.      Automating testing to verify correctness and stability.
5.      Conducting structured team standups to track progress and resolve blockers.
6.      The project mimics real-world software development by introducing challenges such as conflicting user stories, incomplete           specifications, and integration complexities. To succeed, our team must communicate effectively, document progress, and rigorously test the system.
